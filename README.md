Gumdrop is a Mac app for having silly fun with my big screen and my webcam.

You run it in full screen, and it shows my webcam image on the back of a solid colour screen.
In a dark room and with a bright screen, it can really affect the vibe of the space!

This code is **extremely rough** and mostly for me to have fun with.

The interesting parts come from other people:
